    "\n",

Here I'm going to tell it that I would like all of the ERA5 data: that means passing a location called \"ECMWF/ERA5/Daily\" that I got by poking through the [Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/). There are also other ERA5 datasets: since we're going to explore precipitation, I'm using daily information so we can see individual rain events.\n",
